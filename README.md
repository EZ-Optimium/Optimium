Optimium is an AI inference engine that helps users maximize their AI model inference performance. It seamlessly optimizes and deploys models on target devices without requiring any engineering effort. 

## Goal

Optimium currently supports inference acceleration of computer vision models on x86, x64, Arm64 CPUs - within this scope, it outperforms any other inference options. We plan to expand our coverage to Transformer-based models and GPUs, so stay tuned! ðŸ“»
